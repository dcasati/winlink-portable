# Winlink Portable Station

The following describes a setup for a portable Winlink station, using two different radios, the Baofeng UV-5R and the Yaesu FT-818nd. Both radios are connected to a computer using a DigiRig as the audio interface.

> Extended goal:
> 
> If your hardware supports it, we will have a machine that can be used as a "headless modem for Vara". This means that we could use it as a dedicated device for Vara FM/HF and use [RadioMail](https://radiomail.app/) as a Winlink client to connect to it.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The best way to consume this content is by using its [Read The Docs](http://winlink-portable.readthedocs.io/) version.
