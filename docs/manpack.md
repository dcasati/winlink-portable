This is a makeshift manpack that houses a FT-818nd, an LDG z-817 autotunner, and a digirig. Cable management is done by using velcro with the entire frame for the manpack being constructed out of pvc tubbing (1/2") and hockey tape. The overall cost should be around $50 (Canadian Dollars).

## Assemblying the kit

Assembling everything and putting into the backpack is easy since the frame was cut to fit the internal storage of the backpack. You can easily modify this to fit another backpack.
